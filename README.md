# MasterNongMind
> 🔮 Creating a Mastermind puzzle guessing algorithm using permutations and handcrafted rule-based solutions.

### ℹ️ About this Project
- 📚 This project is a team effort as part of the 'CPE231' Algorithm course in the Computer Engineering program at KMUTT.
- 🎯 The primary goal is to apply knowledge in Algorithms, which includes:
  - Implementing permutations (Bruteforce/Heap) to generate every possible code combination.
  - Utilizing Genetic Algorithms to enhance decision-making abilities based on all previous feedback.
